# Mutated images must be rejected, not crashed on.
#
# A `.dream` file is untrusted input: it can arrive from anywhere, and the
# interpreter indexes its arrays without further checks on the strength of the
# loader's validation. So the property under test is narrow and absolute --
# whatever bytes it is handed, the VM exits normally or reports an error, and
# never dies on a signal.
#
# Two different invariants are checked, because they are not the same:
#
#   --dump  loads and walks the image but evaluates nothing, so it must always
#           terminate. A hang here means the loader or the tree walker can be
#           driven in circles, which is a bug.
#   run     evaluates. A mutated image can easily be a valid program that
#           loops forever -- flipping the `1` in `n - 1` to `0` is enough --
#           so a hang here is expected and only a crash is a failure.
