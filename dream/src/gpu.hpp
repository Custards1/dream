// The GPU behind `tensor.gpu`: device memory and the kernels that run on it.
//
// One device per runtime, found on first use and kept for the life of the VM.
// It is reached through OpenCL, loaded with `dlopen` rather than linked: the VM
// gains no build dependency, a machine with no OpenCL runs every program that
// does not ask for a GPU, and one that asks gets an error naming what is
// missing. OpenCL because it is the one API every vendor's GPU answers --
// NVIDIA, AMD, Intel and Apple's -- and because a CPU implementation of it
// (POCL) exists, which is how the tests run this code on a machine without a
// GPU. A CUDA or Metal backend would sit behind the same functions.
//
// Everything is asynchronous except `download`. Operations are enqueued in
// order on one queue and return at once, so a chain of products and sums runs
// on the device back to back without the host waiting on any of them; only
// reading an answer back stops to wait. That is the whole of the speed model,
// and docs/notes/tensors.md has the rest.
