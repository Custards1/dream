/// 354 MB of nursery, 87% of it dead, with no safepoint able to reach any of
/// it. Letting the nested loop collect is what fixes that, and the price is
/// this: a frame that holds a `Value` or an `Obj*` across a force must keep it
/// somewhere the collector rewrites -- `p.stack` or `p.pins` -- and re-read it
/// afterwards, never in a C++ local.
///
/// A vouch covers the frame that makes it and nothing below: `force_whnf`
/// consumes the flag and clears it, so a native reached through the forced
/// expression starts out unvouched like any other. A force nobody vouched for
/// raises `force_pins`, and a collection needs it at zero -- which is what
/// makes the guarantee hold for a *chain* of frames rather than just the
/// nearest one. Two unvouched frames deep, the vouched frame between them
/// still cannot collect, and that is the right answer.
///
/// Declare it at the top of the region that forces, not around each call: the
/// flag is restored on destruction, so a native that forces in a loop vouches
/// once.
///
/// One rule about *where* it may go, learnt the hard way. A native called
/// through `resume_native` has a known chain above it -- `run_process`,
/// `step_eval`, `do_apply`, `resume_native` -- and that chain is audited. A
/// helper the *machine* reaches directly does not: `concat_lists` is the list
/// `+`, and the operator path above it holds both operands in C++ locals, as
/// does any JIT-compiled frame that got there through `dream_rt_arith`. So
/// vouching is for natives, and a helper reached from the machine vouches only
/// if every path to it has been walked. See `PinsTheHeap`.
