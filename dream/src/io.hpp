// Input and output.
//
// The problem this file solves is that a Dream process is not an OS thread.
// Hundreds of thousands of processes share a handful of workers, so a native
// that calls a blocking `read(2)` does not block one process -- it blocks a
// worker, and every process queued behind it.
//
// So IO never blocks a worker. A native tries the operation without blocking;
// if the file descriptor is not ready it registers interest with a poller and
// returns `NativeResult::block()`, which parks the *process* through the same
// handshake `recv!` uses. A poller thread waits in `epoll_wait` and wakes the
// process when the descriptor is ready, and the native is called again. From
// Dream the call looks like an ordinary synchronous one.
//
// The data never crosses a heap boundary: the native reads straight into the
// calling process's heap. That is the reason IO is not a server process here.
// A server would have to deep-copy every buffer into the caller on the way
// back, which doubles the cost of every read and makes one process a
// bottleneck for all IO in the system.
