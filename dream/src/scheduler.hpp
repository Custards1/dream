// Scheduling.

// Processes are multiplexed onto a small pool of OS threads. Each worker owns
// a run queue and steals from its neighbours when it goes hungry. A process
// runs for a fixed number of reductions and is then put back on the queue,
// whatever it was in the middle of -- the same preemption model as BEAM, and
// the reason a tight loop in one process cannot starve the others.
