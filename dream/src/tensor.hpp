// Tensors: what `+ - * / %` do to them, what `@` is, and `std.tensor`.
//
// A tensor is a `TensorObj` (value.hpp): packed doubles with a shape, on the
// host, or a handle to a buffer on the GPU (gpu.hpp). Everything a program can
// do to one is here, and every operation answers a new tensor -- the value
// semantics every other Dream value has. docs/notes/tensors.md is the design.
