// Per-process heaps.
//
// Every process owns its heap outright: nothing in it is reachable from
// another process, because messages are copied on send. That is what BEAM buys
// with copying semantics, and it buys the same things here -- collection never
// stops the world, never takes a lock, and never has to consider another
// thread's view of an object. It is also what makes lazy thunk update safe
// without atomics: only one process can ever force a given thunk.
//
// The heap is generational: fresh objects bump-allocate in the nursery, and a
// minor collection promotes everything still reachable into old space by
// copying. Old space is a mark-sweep that moves only what it chooses to: a
// major collection evacuates the few blocks its last sweep found mostly empty,
// copying their survivors into the holes of the rest and handing the blocks
// back whole (see "Evacuating sparse blocks" in docs/gc.md). Collection is
// still safe at an interpreter safepoint with no native-stack scanning, for the
// reason promotion always was: `alloc` never collects, and what can collect
// underneath a native is exactly what has vouched that its locals survive one.
//
// The design this implements is written down in docs/gc.md ("Phase 1").
