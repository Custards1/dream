// The threads a collection borrows.
//
// A process's collector runs on the thread that owns the process, because that
// is the only thread allowed to touch its heap -- but during a collection the
// mutator is stopped, and while it is stopped the heap has no owner in the
// sense that matters. So the work can be split, and on a machine with cores to
// spare the pause shrinks by roughly the number of threads that join in.
//
// docs/gc.md calls for "idle workers join in". This is that, with the workers
// kept apart from the scheduler's: a scheduler worker is asleep waiting for a
// *process*, and waking it for something that is not a process would put the
// collector inside the run queue's handshake, the deadlock detector's idle
// count, and `wait_for_all`. Separate threads that do nothing but this are the
// same bargain without the entanglement -- and they work in the places that
// have no scheduler at all: the unit tests, and a host embedding the VM.
//
// What the scheduler *does* decide is how many of them may run. `set_idle_hint`
// hands the pool the scheduler's live count of idle workers, and a collection
// recruits no more helpers than there are cores nobody is using. A machine
// whose workers are all busy running processes collects on one thread, which is
// the right answer: the other cores have something better to do.
