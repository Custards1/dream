// The LLVM JIT tier.
//
// Scope, and why it is drawn where it is: this compiles a function's evaluated
// spine -- arithmetic, comparisons, branches, `let`, calls to itself and to
// other functions it can compile, primitive opcodes and host calls, reading and
// building lists, arrays and maps, and calls it hands to the machine -- and
// leaves what the program does not evaluate to the interpreter. The limit is a
// soundness requirement. Compiled code evaluates what it can reach eagerly, and
// doing that to something the program would never have forced can raise an
// error in a program that was going to terminate quietly.
//
// So nothing is evaluated here that the interpreter would not have evaluated.
// An argument is evaluated only where the callee forces that parameter on every
// path -- a strictness fixpoint, per parameter (`Analyzer::run`, "Which
// arguments are evaluated") -- and every other position is *lazy*: its value is
// built in place when building it cannot be observed, and suspended against a
// frame made on demand otherwise, exactly as `thunk_for` would have done (see
// "Lazy positions"). A parameter every self call hands straight back to itself
// is moved rather than computed (`Analyzer::carried`).
//
// This used to be a condition of *admission* -- a function was compiled only
// when every parameter was forced on every path -- which refused every list
// builder, every lazy accumulator and every function that calls what it is
// given. It is a decision per argument now, and those are compiled.
//
// What that rule does *not* promise is that an argument is forced at the same
// point the interpreter would have forced it, only that it is forced. Where two
// errors are reachable that can decide which one a program gets; the repro and
// why it is not fixed are under "The tier's eager arguments can change *which*
// error a program raises" in CLAUDE.md.
//
// A `let` has nowhere to live here -- no thunks, and the frame's slots are
// registers -- so its value is emitted where its name is read, which is where
// the interpreter would have forced the thunk. `Analyzer::check_bind` is the
// rule and what it costs.
//
// Self recursion comes in two shapes and they are compiled differently. A tail
// call is a loop back-edge: the parameters are overwritten and control jumps to
// the top, which is what lets a compiled loop run in constant space and yield
// to the scheduler at every iteration. A *non-tail* call -- `fib (n - 1) +
// fib (n - 2)` -- is a machine call, which means the body has to be a function
// of its arguments rather than of a heap frame. So such a function is emitted
// twice over: an inner body taking its parameters by value, and an outer entry
// matching `CompiledFn` that unpacks the frame once and calls it. The frame the
// interpreter would have allocated per call disappears entirely, which on `fib`
// is the whole program -- 100% of what it allocates is frames.
//
// What that costs is written down in `kStackBudget`: a machine call uses
// machine stack, and machine stack is a fixed resource where a heap
// continuation is not. Compiled recursion therefore carries its depth and
// gives up -- `JIT_DEEP` -- rather than overflow, and the interpreter, whose
// recursion is on the heap and bounded by `DREAM_MAX_DEPTH`, takes the call
// over. That is a fallback, not an error: the program sees what it would have
// seen with no JIT at all.
//
// The fast paths are inline; every slow path calls the interpreter's own
// helper, so the two tiers cannot drift apart on what an operation means.

// Representation
//
// A compiled function carries its values in one of two shapes: a tagged
// `Value`, which is what every other part of the runtime speaks, and a raw
// `double`, which is what a float *is* once nobody has to be able to point at
// it. The second exists because a boxed float is an allocation, and a loop that
// allocates one per operation is a loop the collector runs rather than the CPU:
// `pi` in the benchmark allocated 866 MB to add two million terms, 44% of it
// float boxes, and spent its time in the nursery instead of the FPU.
//
// So the emitter decides, before it writes a line, which values are floats, and
// keeps those in registers. Boxing happens at exactly four places -- the value
// returned to the interpreter, the spill a yield makes into the heap frame, an
// operand handed to a slow-path helper, and a join where the two arms disagree
// -- and nowhere in between. A fused `pi` loop reaches all four zero times per
// iteration.
//
// `Ty` is what makes that safe. `Float` is a claim about the *value*, not about
// the expression: it means "if this reduces without raising, what it reduces to
// is a float". That is exactly what `arith` guarantees -- an operator with a
// float on one side of it answers a float or raises, and has no third case --
// which is why `Unknown + Float` is `Float` even though the left side could
// turn out to be a list. If it is a list, the operation raises, and a raise is
// a return, not a value of the wrong shape.
//
// A parameter is the one place the claim cannot be proved, because its value
// comes from the caller. So it is *guarded* instead: a slot the loop carries as
// a double is checked on entry, and a function entered with something else in
// it answers `JIT_BAIL` and is run by the interpreter, which is what would have
// happened had it never been compiled.
//
// Which parameters are floats has two sources. The fixpoint finds the ones a
// loop's own self calls make floats -- `acc + 1.0 / k` -- and a **signature**
// names the rest: a parameter declared `:float` starts the fixpoint as Float
// rather than as Unknown (the image's `TYPE` section, `Image::float_params`).
// The second is what reaches `go (x + dx) dx (acc + x * dx)`, where no float
// literal appears and the fixpoint alone would never say `x` is one. It is a
// guess and is treated as one, because the types are gradual: a caller with no
// signature may pass an integer, and the guard that makes the fixpoint's own
// answers safe makes this one safe too. A declared float that turns out to be
// an integer costs a bail, and a run of them gives the function up
// (`Jit::note_bail`); it never costs an answer.

// through primitive opcodes or builtins -- `str_byte`, `compare`, `len`
// -- is a call, and until this existed a single one of them refused the whole
// function. That refusal was most of what kept the tier to hand-shaped numeric
// loops: a lexer that reads a byte, a resolver that looks a name up in a map and
// a comparison written over `compare` are all arithmetic with one call in
// the middle of them.
//
// A call is made the way the interpreter makes one -- same callee value, same
// arguments on the same stack, same native -- so the two tiers cannot disagree
// about what a native means. What decides whether a call may be *compiled* is
// below, and it is three questions:
//
//   * **Is it pure?** Purity is spelling in this language, so this is one look
//     at the last character of the name. An impure native is refused, and that
//     one rule is what makes the rest of this simple: nothing here has to order
//     an effect against anything, and nothing here can park -- every native that
//     answers `NativeOutcome::Block` is impure, and so is everything reachable
//     from the Dream work a pure one runs underneath itself.
//   * **Is it saturated, and narrow enough?** A partial application has no
//     callee to enter, and a variadic native has no fixed argument positions for
//     a strict mask to describe. `kMaxNativeArgs` is the rest.
//   * **What of the arguments it does not force?** A native forces the ones its
//     mask claims and is handed the others suspended. Those are lazy positions,
//     written as the interpreter would write them: built in place where that
//     cannot be observed, suspended otherwise. See "Lazy positions".
//
// What is deliberately *not* asked is whether the native allocates, or forces,
// or runs Dream code underneath itself. Allocation never collects, so compiled
// code has always been allowed to allocate -- `dream_rt_float` does -- and
// forcing is what `dream_rt_force` already does on every slot read. Both are the
// runtime's to get right, and `run_native` in jit_rt.cpp is where it does.

//
// Most of what a list or a map function does is put something *somewhere
// nobody has looked yet*: the head and tail of a new cell, an element of a
// literal, the value stored under a key, an argument the callee may never
// force. The interpreter suspends each of those (`thunk_for`), and until this
// existed a compiled body had no way to, because a thunk is a node and a frame
// and a compiled body has no frame -- its slots are registers. So every such
// position refused the function, and with it every list builder, every map
// fold and every loop carrying a lazy accumulator.
//
// A position like that is now written one of two ways, and neither evaluates
// anything the interpreter would not have:
//
//   * **Built in place**, when producing the value cannot be observed: a
//     literal, a slot handed over as it stands, a cell or a literal list of
//     such things (a cell is already a value, and building one cannot raise),
//     and the shapes `thunk_for` itself computes -- `+ - *` of two fixnums in
//     hand, an array or list element already in hand. Those last are decided at
//     run time, exactly as `thunk_for` decides them, and fall to the second way
//     when the operands are not what they need to be.
//   * **Suspended**, otherwise: a frame is made on demand holding what the
//     slots hold right now (`dream_rt_snapshot`), and the expression is a thunk
//     against it. That is the frame the interpreter would have been running
//     this iteration in, so the thunk means what the interpreter's would have
//     meant -- and the expression inside it is the interpreter's to run, so it
//     needs no support from this file at all. One frame serves every
//     suspension an iteration makes.
//
// The first is what makes a builder cost nothing but its data:
// `upto (i + 1) n (cons i acc)` allocates one cell an iteration and no thunk,
// no frame, no trip through the interpreter. The second is what makes the
// rest *admissible*: `map f xs` still suspends `f x` and the recursion, because
// the program says to, but the loop around them is compiled.
//
// What decides whether a self call's or a peer's argument is in a lazy position
// is the callee's strictness, and that is now asked rather than required. See
// "Which arguments are evaluated" in `Analyzer::run`.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // where two branches disagree the sequence stops, and if a float slot is
    // not inside the part that is definite, the specialization is dropped

    // which forces each on first read exactly as before.

// Typed peers
//
// A peer used to be all-tagged, for a reason that was right: its signature has
// to be the same for every caller, and a double parameter is a decision about
// what callers pass. So a float helper called from a compiled float loop cost
// a box for every argument going in and one for the answer coming out -- three
// allocations an iteration for `acc + term (to_float i)`, which is the whole of
// what that loop allocated.
//
// A signature is a decision that does not depend on the caller, which is what
// the missing piece was. A peer whose signature declares a float parameter is
// emitted twice: the generic variant, every parameter tagged, as before; and a
// typed one, the declared floats (and whatever the fixpoint finds follows from
// them) as doubles. A call site whose arguments are already doubles calls the
// typed variant with them in registers. One holding a tagged value checks it
// -- it is evaluated, so a float is a float box -- and calls the typed variant
// if every such argument is one and the generic variant otherwise, which is
// where an integer the types allowed an unannotated caller to pass ends up,
// and it gets exactly what the interpreter would give it.
//
// Either variant hands back a raw double when its *body* is a float -- a fact
// the analysis establishes, not the signature, and so true of untyped peers
// too: `1.0 / (k * k + 1.0)` is a float whatever `k` is, or it raises. The
// bits travel in the return register the tagged value used, and are only read
// once the status says `JIT_OK`, because on any other status that register
// holds an error or a placeholder. The caller's analysis knows which variant
// answers what (`peer_call_ty`), so a loop accumulating a peer's answer carries
// that accumulator as a double as well.

/// `collatz` -- a loop whose body is `acc + collatz_steps x` -- ran interpreted
/// while `collatz_steps` beside it was compiled. A call to another global
/// function is now compiled the way a non-tail self call already was: the
/// callee is emitted as a function of its arguments, into the same module, and
/// called. There is no frame, no thunk and no trip through the interpreter.
///
/// The soundness argument is the one the tier already rests on. Compiled code
/// evaluates an argument before making a call only where the callee would have

/// callee's strictness, per parameter. Asking that of the callee is asking
/// exactly what the tier asks of itself, which is why the test below is
/// `Analyzer::run` and not a second set of rules.
///
/// Mutual recursion makes the question circular: `f` is admissible if `g` is,

// `integrate x hi dx acc` is the shape that needs it: the condition forces `x`

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Recursion that is a loop
//
// `len xs = if is_empty xs { 0 } else { 1 + len (tail xs) }` is recursion, and
// until this it was compiled as recursion: a machine call per level, and past
// `kStackBudget` -- a few thousand levels -- `JIT_DEEP`, which gives the
// function to the interpreter for good. Over a long list that is every list
// function written the natural way, and the interpreter then spends a heap
// continuation per element to hold the pending additions.
//
// Two shapes of recursion are loops in disguise, and are compiled as loops:
//
//   * `e + f ..` as the answer, where `e` makes no self call. Every level adds
//     its `e` to what the next level answers, so what is pending is one number:
//     the sum of the `e`s so far. The loop carries it and adds the base case's
//     answer at the end.
//   * `let r = f ..; .. r` with `r` read as the answer, which is a tail call
//     written through a name -- `filter` skipping an element is the shape.
//     Nothing is pending but the level itself.
//
// What makes the first sound is the part worth reading twice. The interpreter
// evaluates `e1 + (e2 + (e3 + b))`: every `e` in order on the way down, then
// the additions innermost first on the way back. The loop evaluates the `e`s in
// the same order -- so anything they raise, they raise at the same point -- and
// sums them as it goes. For fixnums the two sums are the same number *only if
// no partial sum the interpreter makes leaves the fixnum range*, because one
// that does becomes a float and every addition after it is a float addition.
// Those partial sums are the suffix sums `T - P(j-1)`, where `T` is the total
// and `P` the prefix sums the loop has, so the loop keeps the least and the
// greatest prefix sum and checks both ends at the end, in 128 bits. When any `e`
// or the base is not a fixnum, or the check fails, the call is given back to
// the interpreter (`JIT_BAIL`) and run from its frame: nothing compiled code
// did was an effect, and what it forced stays forced, so running it again
// answers exactly what the interpreter would have answered the first time.
//
// A yield is the one thing a pending level cannot survive -- the interpreter
// resumes the body in a frame, and a frame has no room for the accumulator --
// so the loop does not yield while a level is pending. What bounds that is the
// interpreter's own depth limit: past `DREAM_MAX_DEPTH` pending levels the call
// is handed back with `JIT_DEEP`, and the interpreter, doing it on the heap,
// overflows where it always did. Below the limit the loop answers; the
// interpreter, which may spend more than one continuation a level, can run out
// sooner, and that difference -- a recursion deep enough to overflow one tier
// and not the other -- is the one this admits.

// Compiling in the background.
//
// LLVM charges about ten milliseconds a function, and a program that is not a
// numeric kernel has hundreds of functions worth compiling -- the compiler's own
// self-compile makes four hundred of them hot, which is four seconds, and every
// one of them used to be paid by the program at the moment the function got
// hot, with the program stopped. Nothing needs it to be: until a compiled body
// exists the interpreter runs the function exactly as it did while it was cold,
// and the two tiers agree on every answer, so *when* the compiled body arrives
// is not observable. So a hot function is queued, a thread compiles the queue,
// and each body is published into `cached_` the moment it is done. A process
// is one green thread and the machine has more cores than that; the compile is
// paid on one of the others.
//
// Synchronous compilation is kept for a threshold of one, which is what the
// tests use to make sure a function's *compiled* body is the one they exercise
// -- and for `DREAM_JIT_SYNC`, when that is wanted anywhere else.
